    <h2 id="section-music">Music</h2>
    <p>I enjoy making music, primarily hip-hop and jazz-hop. I've been making music, on and off, since 2007. I've performed at cultural events and colleges all around the Midwest.</p>

    <p>I enjoy making music because the writing process is therapeutic for me.</p>

    My hometown, I learned to love it when I left it, yes<br />
    I’m blessed that it appears to me like it had only been<br />
    Yesterday my heart reverberated with the El tracks<br />
    I take the Brown down, switch to Red on the way back<br />
    I pass the sax man at Jackson, the Pho spot on Broadway<br />
    Artwork on rooftops, the life that we embody<br />
    Night lights strung across the pieces of our city<br />
    Mixed in with the memories, Chicago’s roots embedded in me<br />
    The start of slam, the vision of movements<br />
    Progression of community through struggle of students<br />
    The basis for hip-hop and the strength of our wind<br />
    All collide and combine and create who I am from within<br />
    But even with my city always surging through my veins<br />
    Every time that I’m away I’m steady counting down the days<br />
    Right down to the second that I make it to my place<br />
    So yo lemme say<br />
    <br />
    Tell you I’m used to being used to<br />
    Going through with the motions<br />
    Every time I’m away<br />
    Everyday my thoughts just drive me insane<br />
    Cuz I feel, you prefer the world beyond oceans<br />
    Looking out into space, to the place that’s always keeping my faith<br />
    <br />
    Home, home is where the heart is<br />
    And it always feels the hardest when the distance spans the farthest<br />
    When the target of my dreams just feels farther than it seems<br />
    And it causes me to think whether or not this is for me<br />
    Every time I'm on the road, I reflect back through the mirrors<br />
    But the vision of my kin and loved ones appear unclearer<br />
    And fade out all the memories, fragments of my timeline<br />
    Just all collide and begin fading into the night skyline<br />
    I gotta get, get, gotta, gotta get home<br />
    Return to my ohana, back to my heart and my soul<br />
    I'm feeling so lost, I forgot the road goes<br />
    Now my goals are in the dark, I don't know them no mo'<br />
    I gotta get, get, gotta, gotta get home<br />
    Salutations to my fam cuz they made me possible<br />
    Aspirations that I'm chasing always keep me on the go<br />
    Gracing stages while they waiting til I finally come home

    <h2 id="section-basketball">Basketball</h2>
    <p>I fell in love with basketball in 2007. Prior to this, I did not follow any sport whatsoever, and the extent of my experience with sports was grade school recess activities. But one random day at the lunch table, my friend showed me this man.</p>
    <img id="ray" src="ray-allen.jpg" alt="Ray Allen">
    <p>Ray Allen was my introduction to the game of basketball. 3 point shooting became the one thing I wanted to do, and that's all I did when I played. To this day, my game is that of a 3 point shooter, and my favorite team remains the Boston Celtics.</p>
